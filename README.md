# ufc-division-analysis
This R project digs into how stable each UFC division actually is, because people love to say “that division is chaos” without knowing if it’s real volatility or just a lot of good fighters. I looked at title turnover, fight volume, and how often champs keep their belts versus how fast they get replaced. Some divisions are straight dynasties with long-reigning champs, others are revolving doors where nobody holds power long enough to hang posters. The interesting takeaway: divisions with tons of title fights don’t necessarily get more chaotic. The regression basically shrugged and said, “Yeah, more fights doesn’t explain anything.” A few divisions stay stable even when they’re busy, and a few go full musical chairs even when title bouts are rare. The so called “volatile” divisions (Lightweight, Women’s Strawweight, etc.) aren’t random or messy, they’re just stacked with contenders who can actually dethrone champions. In other words, high turnover doesn’t always mean chaos, sometimes it just means talent depth. This repo includes the R Markdown, the final PDF, and the cleaned data so everything can be reproduced without pain. If you want to knit it yourself, just install tidyverse and hit knit. I made this mostly to separate myth from reality: some divisions aren’t unstable, they’re just competitive. If you have opinions, argue with me, because someone will absolutely say their division is “the hardest in the UFC” and now I have numbers to call bluff.

I created two different metrics:
